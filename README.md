# Individual-Project
Individual Project for the first nine weeks of the second semester of Comp Sci III.

Two Possible Ideas

Tic-Tac-Toe
- make a tic-tac-toe game that has a functional and sleek interface
- has an intelligent computer opponent system
- account for invalid user inputs, such as trying to put o's on top of already existing x's and vice versa
- maybe make different difficulties of computer opponents?

Traffic + Weather
- make a map interface that displays traffic and weather data at the same time
- should have the same functionality as all other maps (e.g. directions, points of interests)
- weather should be accurate and up to date (maybe even incorporate future forecasts based on length of trips?)
